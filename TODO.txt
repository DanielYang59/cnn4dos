1. Refactor "shifting-experiments"
    a. add "all orbital shifting"
    b. optimize shifting algorithm


2. Move limiting potential calculation and verification module from "volcano plot" to "supporting info"


3. Replace string manipulation of path with pathlib.


4. HER volcano plot not working.


5. Kendall correlation map: "eBader" not italian for "Bader"


6. Testing area under "volcanoPlotter" is not working (import error)
