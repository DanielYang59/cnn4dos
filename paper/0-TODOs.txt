# Main
update figures with high resolution ones
format for Nature Communications submission (https://www.nature.com/ncomms/submit/how-to-submit)

# SI
Table align width (try toprule/bottomrule)
should table headers be centered (and bold)?
should table/figure header/title be capitalized?
some sections in SI don't start in new page
double-check figure size and position (some extra large figures go to the next section/page)
