# MPhil Research Project "cnn4dos": Adsorption Energy Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources developed during my [MPhil research project](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/241290/) at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The project focuses on predicting adsorption energy from density of states (DOS) with convolutional neural networks (CNN).

## Description

This project investigated the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 228 supported single atom catalysts via density functional theory method. Furthermore, electronic descriptors and elementary descriptors were selected trying to elucidate the correlation between catalytic performance and intrinsic performance of investigated candidates. Among them, electronic density of states, inspired by the d-band theory, were selected to establish a direct descriptor-performance mapping through convolutional neural networks. Resulted neural network model achieved a mean absolute error on the order of 0.1 eV.

## TODO

A detailed introduction would be added shortly.
