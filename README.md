> Meanwhile the development of the general purpose Python package has been relocated to:\
[ml4dos](https://github.com/DanielYang59/ml4dos): for machine learning for electronic density of states (eDOS)\
OR \
[scaling](https://github.com/DanielYang59/scaling): for working with catalysts scaling relations
